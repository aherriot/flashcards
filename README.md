flashcards
==========

A Persian/English flashcards app written in AngularJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB.

This app implements the [Leitner System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) of studying flashcards, where words are sorted into buckets from one to five, based on how well each word is known.  Words that are missed often are practiced more.

Unlike other flashcard apps, this one has three sided cards (English, Persian, and phonetic persian (latin alphabet)).  This allows me to practice pronounciation as well as vocabulary.
